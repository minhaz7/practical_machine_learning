==============================

My project for the Johns Hopkins Practical Machine Learning course in the Data Science specialization 

1. First download the two .csv files in the same directory where the R code resides.

2.

Before running the markdown file run the following command

install.packages("Hmisc")
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("randomForest")
install.packages("doParallel")
install.packages("foreach")
install.packages("e1071")


These commands would install the necessary packages for the code to run successfully.
